Telegram DM bridge for pi.

## Install

From git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/badlogic/pi-telegram
```

Or for a single run:

```bash
pi -e git:github.com/badlogic/pi-telegram
```

## Configure

### Telegram

1. Open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Run `/newbot`
3. Pick a name and username
4. Copy the bot token

### pi

Start pi, then run:

```bash
/telegram-setup
```

Paste the bot token when prompted.

The extension stores config in:

```text
~/.pi/agent/telegram.json
```

## Connect a pi session

The Telegram bridge is session-local. Connect it only in the pi session that should own the bot:

```bash
/telegram-connect
```

To stop polling in the current session:

```bash
/telegram-disconnect
```

Check status:

```bash
/telegram-status
```

## Pair your Telegram account

After token setup and `/telegram-connect`:

1. Open the DM with your bot in Telegram
2. Send `/start`

The first DM user becomes the allowed Telegram user for the bridge. The extension only accepts messages from that user.

## Usage

Chat with your bot in Telegram DMs.

### Send text

Send any message in the bot DM. It is forwarded into pi with a `[telegram]` prefix.

### Send images and files

Send images, albums, or files in the DM.

The extension:
- downloads them to `~/.pi/agent/tmp/telegram`
- includes local file paths in the prompt
- forwards inbound images as image inputs to pi

### Ask for files back

If you ask pi for a file or generated artifact, pi should call the `telegram_attach` tool. The extension then sends those files with the next Telegram reply.

Examples:
- `summarize this image`
- `read this README and summarize it`
- `write me a markdown file with the plan and send it back`
- `generate a shell script and attach it`

### Stop a run

In Telegram, send:

```text
stop
```

or:

```text
/stop
```

That aborts the active pi turn.

### Queue follow-ups

If you send more Telegram messages while pi is busy, they are queued and processed in order.

### Reply to an earlier bot message

Use Telegram's normal **Reply** action on a bot message, then send a short response such as `hint` or a longer comment. The bridge includes the replied-to message in a clearly marked context block for Pi, so scheduled digests and other bot messages remain understandable even though they were sent outside the current Pi conversation.

Pi's first response chunk quotes your Telegram message, keeping the exchange visually grouped in the DM.

## Replies and recovery

Streaming previews are currently disabled. The extension waits until Pi has settled before sending the final Telegram reply, so transient provider errors, automatic retries, and compaction recovery are not exposed as terminal Telegram errors.

A genuine terminal error is sent only after Pi has exhausted automatic recovery. Requested attachments remain queued across retries and are sent with the final successful reply.

## Notes

- Only one pi session should be connected to the bot at a time
- Reply text and returned attachments quote the originating Telegram message when it is still available
- Long replies are split below Telegram's 4096 character limit
- Outbound files are sent via `telegram_attach`
